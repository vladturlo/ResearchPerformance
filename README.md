# Uncovering one's research performance
The analysis of an available data to determine one's research performance in a way that it can be included into the resume.

While comparing the age, at which PhD degree was received, or the length of the PhD study might depend on a lot on circumstances, this might be just a good information to know.

However, determining the research performance seems to be more objective if analysing each paper (1) by how large is the journal impact factor, the paper was published at, as compared to other journals in the field, or (2) by how well the paper is cited as compared to the other papers in the field published at the same year.

Moreover, grouping papers by the author contribution (the first author, the middle author, or the last author) may give another degree of freedom in analyzing one's research performance.

Obtained in this way findings may surprise eve the researcher of interest. For example, one paper of V. Turlo (mine) published in 2018 received 8 citations, which doesn't seem to be a lot. However, by comparison with the corresponding percentiles for Materials Science for 2018, I discovered that my paper is the top 1% most cited paper in the field.
